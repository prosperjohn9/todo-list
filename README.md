This project was created for the [Todo List](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list) assignment as part of The Odin Project curriculum. I met all the assignment objectives and then expanded on it with my own concepts to make it more functional and user-friendly.

1. Have projects or separate lists of todos
2. ‘Default’ project to which all todos are put
3. Create new projects and choose which project todos go into
4. UI Requirements:
   - View all todos
   - View todos in each project
   - Edit todos
   - Delete todos
5. Separate application logic from DOM manipulation
